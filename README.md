                                                                                                                    March 2018
- Performed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and built regression and classification models for house price predictions
- Applied Random Forest, Ridge and support vector regression algorithms to train the regression model;
- Applied Random Forest and PCA to train classification model
- Reduced feature dimensions using PCA and achieved up to 88% accuracy.
